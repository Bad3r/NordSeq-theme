# Logseq Dev Theme

A theme inspired by Dev.to & Figma.

## Warnings
- I only use the light theme on daily basis.
- Subject to change to meet my own needs.
- I only have a Mac and other systems will not be tested.
- I like Google Fonts and Fira Code.

The easiest way to adopt this theme is to use jsDelivr CDN.

1. Specify `:custom-css-url` in "logseq/config.edn"
2. Add the following line to your `custom.css`:
  ```css
  @import url('https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/pengx17/logseq-dev-theme@master/custom.css');
  ```
