## Working Demo

https://knowledge-garden.vercel.app/

## Usage

The easiest way to adopt this theme is to use jsDelivr CDN by adding the following line to your `custom.css`. You can also change the `@main` part to use the latest version.

```css
/* This must be the first line of the custom.css with other import rules */
@import url("https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/pengx17/logseq-dev-theme@main/custom.css");

/* You can also add other styles below to override the default theme values */
```

Alternatively, you can download this repo and load it as a Logseq Theme Plugin.
